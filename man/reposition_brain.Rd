\usage{
reposition_brain(
  data,
  position = "horizontal",
  nrow = NULL,
  ncol = NULL,
  views = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{sf-data.frame of joined brain atlas and data}

\item{position}{Position formula for slices. For cortical atlases, use
formulas like `hemi ~ view`. For subcortical/tract atlases, use
"horizontal", "vertical", or `type ~ .` for type-based layout.}

\item{nrow}{Number of rows for grid layout (subcortical/tract only)}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for grid layout (subcortical/tract only)}

\item{views}{Character vector specifying view order (subcortical/tract only)}
}
\value{
sf-data.frame with re-positioned slices
}
\description{
Function for repositioning
pre-joined atlas data (i.e. data and atlas
already joined to a single data frame).
This makes it possible for users to
reposition the geometry data for the atlas
for control over final plot layout. For even
more detailed control over the positioning,
the "hemi" and "view" columns should be
converted into factors and ordered by wanted
order of appearance.
}
\examples{
reposition_brain(dk, hemi ~ view)
reposition_brain(dk, view ~ hemi)
reposition_brain(dk, hemi + view ~ .)
reposition_brain(dk, . ~ hemi + view)

\dontrun{
# Subcortical with grid layout
reposition_brain(aseg_data, nrow = 2)

# Subcortical with specific views
reposition_brain(aseg_data, views = c("sagittal", "axial_3"))
}
}
